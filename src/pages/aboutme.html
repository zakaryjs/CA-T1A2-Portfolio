            <div class="twocolumn">
                <div><p>Hi! My name is Zakary, and I am seventeen years old. I live in a small country town in WA. 
                        I have always loved technology, and have always had an interest in helping others as well as computer programming. 
                        At just four years old, I found great joy from my PlayStation 2 and this quickly evolved into a love for technology as a whole.
                    </p>
                    <p>Other hobbies that I partake in include travelling, watching anime and collecting trading cards (Pokemon and One Piece). I have plans to travel to Japan in 2024 to celebrate my journey into adulthood and my love for anime!
                    </p>
                    <p>In 2022, due to the rise in COVID cases in Western Australia I began to complete online school full time.
                        It was during this time that I began to think about my future career, and a reddit post which introduced me to Coder Academy.
                        Even though the bootcamp has only just began, I can confidently say that it has been an awesome experience, and I have learned so much already!
                    </p>
