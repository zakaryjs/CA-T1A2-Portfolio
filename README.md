## Portfolio Description
<hr>

### Purpose
The purpose of this portfolio is to display information about myself and my works to potential future employers. The website contains different pages in order to share information about myself; about me, what my hobbies and interests are, what I'm good at, and what I have worked on. The design goal from the start was to be simple - the black and white colour scheme made it easy to highlight areas of importance, and though it is not the most creative, I feel it has a professional look to it. 

The information is displayed this way so that my site is easy to navigate, and easy to understand. I feel that in the future I may expand on this; add more detail to each page and maybe adjust the page structure. However, for now I feel this is fine. 

### Functionality / Features
The website, in it's current state, is fully functional with responsive breakpoints for mobile, tablet and desktop devices. Created with a mobile-first design view, the design itself was really easily scalable and adoptable for the larger screen sizes.

The site features a range of pages, as mentioned above, in order to share my personality, interests, resume and projects that I have worked on. The site features clickable buttons, both on the ```Home Page``` as redirects for other key pages on the site, and in the ```Skills and Interests Page```, for access to my resume. Images are used in a few of the pages to accompany the text on said page, and the contact page features an interactive form as a means to contact me. The contact page, located in the site footer, is positioned next to Github and LinkedIn hyperlinks, which will soon feature straight redirects to my profile on the respective site.

### Target Audience

The primary target audience for this site is to provide future employers with an insight as to who I am, what I am about and how I have applied myself in the field of web development. I aim to ensure that this site is always up to date, whether it be my latest thoughts or ideas on the blog page, or my latest projects that I have pushed to Github.

I also hope that my site is accessible to those who may want to see a real world example of someone who has gone through the journey of learning full stack development, or to those that just have a general interest in technology or programming. 

### Tech Stack

This website has been developed with the use of HTML5 and CSS. The website has been deployed via Netlify through a connection to a Github Repository; which allows for the site to be updated as commits are pushed.

This README has been written in markdown.
